Notes:
1. Requires installation of ggvis R library.
2. Uses the mtcars dataset.
3. If running in R Studio, run each visualizaiton separately (i.e., run the first one, stop it and then run the next).
4. R markdown file contains additional comments and tutorial steps.


Based on the ggvis examples and tutorials at http://ggvis.rstudio.com/
